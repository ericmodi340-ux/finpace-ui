### Consent and Disclosure to Electronic Transactions, Signatures, Communications, and Identity Verification

Welcome to {{data.firmName}}'s ("we," "our," and/or "us") electronic experience, hosted by Finpace Technology, LLC ("Finpace"). Please carefully read and review these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") before signing any communications, agreements, documents and disclosures (collectively, "Documents") or otherwise using the electronic experience.

By accessing or using our electronic experience, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please DO NOT use this electronic experience for any reason. By agreeing to these Terms, you also authorize us (and Finpace) to verify your identity using electronic or other means and to deliver Documents and communications electronically.

### 1. Introduction

This Consent and Disclosure to Electronic Transactions, Signatures, Communications, and Identity Verification ("Consent") applies to all interactions, communications, transactions, agreements and Documents that we provide to you or that you sign in connection with the specific service, account, or relationship you have with us as well as all identity verification processes conducted through Finpace's platform.

### 2. Scope of Consent and Electronic Signing

By agreeing to this Consent, you acknowledge that your electronic signature is legally binding, just as if you had signed on paper, and you consent to sign electronically. This includes, but is not limited to, entering into agreements, submitting confirmation, and receiving notices and disclosures electronically.  You also agree to receive electronically all Documents, communications, notices, contracts, and agreements arising from or relating to your relationship with us, including but not limited to, advisory contracts, custodial registration(s), transactions, disclosures, notices, etc. that may be sent to you electronically by {{data.firmName}} through Finpace's platform.

### 3. Intent to Sign Electronically

When you provide your electronic signature, you declare your intent to sign the relevant Document electronically and to be legally bound by its terms and conditions. You acknowledge that your electronic signature is the legal equivalent of your manual handwritten signature. By clicking "I Consent" or similar buttons, you are signing electronically. You agree your electronic signature is the legal equivalent of your manual handwritten signature on this Agreement and/or any Documents you sign through ESIGN experience.

### 4. Consent to Electronic Delivery

You agree that we (and Finpace) may provide you with any communications in electronic format, and that we may discontinue or refrain from sending paper communications to you, unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. All communications in electronic format from us to you will be considered "in writing."

### 5. Withdrawal of Consent

You may withdraw your consent to receive communications electronically or to electronic identify verification by writing to us at {{data.firmEmail}}. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must provide your signature on paper documents, which may delay the speed at which we can complete certain transactions and may result in limited access to our services (or the Finpace platform), as identity verification is critical to conducting business safely and securely.

### 6. Accuracy of Information and Updating Your Contact Information

You affirm that all information provided during the verification process is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Providing false or misleading information may result in a denial of service, termination of your account, or legal action. It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that we can communicate with you electronically. You understand and agree that if we send you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, we will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively. You should update your contact information by logging into finpace.app/settings or by contacting your relationship at {{data.firmName}}.

### 7. Hardware and Software Requirements

To access and retain the electronic communications, you will need:

- A computer or device with Internet access.
- A current web browser that includes 128-bit encryption (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).
- A valid and accessible email account.
- Software to view files in PDF format (e.g., Adobe Acrobat Reader, Xodo, etc.).

### 8. Purpose of Identity Verification

The purpose of conducting identity verification is to comply with regulatory requirements and to prevent fraud and unauthorized access to your personal and financial information. This process is essential for protecting you and our systems from fraudulent activities.

- Electronic Database Checks: We may use third-party databases to verify information against official records.
- Document Verification: You may be required to provide digital copies of identification documents such as a driver's license, passport, or national ID card.
- Biometric Verification: We may use biometric methods (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint scanning) where applicable.
- Knowledge-Based Authentication: Answering security questions based on information only you would know.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): We may use 2FA to verify your identity during key interactions with our services, particularly when accessing sensitive information or performing critical actions.

### 10. Consent to Use Third-Party Services

You acknowledge that we (and/or Finpace) may use third-party services to assist in the verification of your identity. These third parties are carefully selected and must comply with our security and privacy standards.
